Online Chess
=============

Online chess is a fullstack website for users to play chess with random users online.

Technologies I am using: ReactJS/Node.js/Express.js/Socket.IO/MySQL

In my project, I am:
* Creating a responsive webpage using ReactJS.
* Using Node.js and Express.js for the server side of the application.
* Using Socket.IO to improve the bi-directional connection between the web client and server.
* Using MySQL to store user profiles for a login system.
* Deploying the frontend to Google Firebase and backend to Heroku.
